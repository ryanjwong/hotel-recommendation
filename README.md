# Hotel Recommendation System
### By: Akshat Jain, Ryan Wong, Eunice Cho

Our project focuses on developing a hotel recommendation system using Naive Bayes. Our system will recommend hotels based on customer reviews and hotel attributes. We will also incorporate sentiment analysis on reviews. The goal of our model is to produce the best hotel option for the user.

Explain what your AI agent does in terms of PEAS. What is the "world" like? 

Our agent is a hotel recommendation system which aims to produce the best hotel option for the user. The performance measure will be user feedback on how they rate the hotel we recommend to them. The environment will be the device the user uses to interact with the model. The actuators are the hotels that our agent recommends to the users based on their hotel preferences and hotel reviews. The sensors will be the data we receive from users about how much they are willing to spend on a hotel as well as which type of hotel they would like to stay in.


What kind of agent is it? Goal based? Utility based? etc. 

Our agent is a goal-based agent which aims to recommend hotels that aligns with the user preferences. The agent uses probabilistic reasoning through Naive Bayes, which calculates the likelihood of a hotel being a good fit for a user based on their preferences. 

Describe how your agent is set up and where it fits in probabilistic modeling
